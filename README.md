# Automatic Room Lighting Model
#### This repository contains a simple room lighting system made using Tinkercad. I made this back in 2021 while I was giving the Induction challenge for The Robotics Society(RISC) of our Institute. In that challenge we were given a fixed number of components and were told to make the best possible model that can be used in real life out of that.
